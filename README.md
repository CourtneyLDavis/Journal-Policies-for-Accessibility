## Abstract
Recent work has illuminated inequities in academic publishing, but little attention has been paid to the inequities disabled scientists face. We reviewed the websites of 541 ecology and evolution journals to examine the extent that they prompt authors to prepare accessible manuscripts. Nearly three-quarters of journals do not encourage authors to consider accessibility when preparing manuscripts. Existing guidelines primarily focus on colorblind-friendly figures, which was mentioned almost twice as much as other recommendations. Our survey signals an urgent need for widespread journal policy reforms. We conclude with recommendations for an iterative process of reform in collaboration with the disability community.
